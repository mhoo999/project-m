      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the geolocation service implementation into subtasks including permission handling, coordinate retrieval, error handling, caching mechanism, and security considerations. For each subtask, provide implementation details and testing approach.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves working with browser permissions, asynchronous API calls, error handling, and security considerations. The Geolocation API requires secure contexts (HTTPS), has privacy implications, and needs fallback mechanisms. The caching requirement adds state management complexity."

      "reasoning": "This service requires implementing complex filtering logic including distance calculations using the Haversine formula. It needs to handle multiple filter criteria simultaneously and prepare for future external API integration. The sample data creation also requires significant effort."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the restaurant marker implementation into subtasks for creating markers based on restaurant data, implementing custom marker icons by category, creating interactive tooltips/info windows, and handling marker click events.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves deep integration with the map API to create, position, and style markers. It requires implementing interactive elements (tooltips) and handling user interactions. The markers need to be efficiently managed as restaurants are filtered."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the restaurant list component implementation into subtasks for creating the basic list structure, implementing sorting functionality, handling restaurant selection and highlighting, and ensuring responsive design for different screen sizes.",
      "reasoning": "This component requires creating a scrollable, interactive list with sorting capabilities. It needs to handle selection state and coordinate with the map component. The responsive design requirements add some complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the random restaurant recommendation feature into subtasks for creating the UI component, implementing the category-based filtering logic, developing the random selection algorithm with animation effects, and integrating with the map component for highlighting selected restaurants.",
      "reasoning": "This feature combines UI animation with filtering logic and random selection. The animation sequence adds complexity, and it needs to integrate with both the category filter and map components."

      "reasoning": "This is a complex task that involves integrating all other components and implementing responsive layouts for different devices. It requires managing the overall application state and coordinating between multiple components. The mobile/desktop adaptation adds significant complexity."
